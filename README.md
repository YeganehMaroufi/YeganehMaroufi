ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Yeganeh Maroufi, a software engineering student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Islamic Azad University, Qazvin. I previously earned my Associate degree from Tehran Valiasr Technical University, where I honed my skills in software development.

ðŸ’» I have a strong interest in front-end development and am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey started with a final project where I developed a fully functional clothing store using WordPress, showcasing my ability to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites.

ðŸš€ Now, I'm diving deeper into front-end technologies, exploring modern frameworks like React, and working on new projects to expand my expertise. I'm passionate about building interactive user interfaces that enhance the user experience.

ðŸŽ¯ My long-term goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer with a focus on front-end development. Iâ€™m eager to learn new technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with others in the tech community.

ðŸ“« Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me on [LinkedIn] (www.linkedin.com/in/yeganeh-maroufi-b4a280226).
